There are a couple of novel problems remaining.
What does it mean when i refer to another element from a path?

Each element slot becomes a factory.
If doing a {}[], it creates a new object per request and stuffs the {} into it
If just doing [], it returns a the same instance on subsequent calls

Also, how are events wired together?  I think through [] type references.


To resolve rows="[:noteList/@rows]" I think I need to do something like GetProperty in Dynamic templates
It needs to have a reference to go retrieve the object
